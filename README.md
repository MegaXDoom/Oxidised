# Oxidised
A rust interpreter
It is a very work-in-progress project not designed for anyone to use, but you can if you want.
Instructions to use:
  compile the project and run the file with an argument containing the path for the file you want to run
    end you file in .oxi (might be optional, but it looks cools)
  the syntax of the language is laid out in the example file, but there are likely more features like strings and etc. (just use trial and error or look at the source code)
  there is a large amount of debuging information displayed when your program is ran
