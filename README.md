# Oxidised
A rust interpreter
It is a very work-in-progress project not designed for anyone, but you can use it if you want.
Instructions to use:
  Compile the project and run the file with an argument containing the path for the file you want to 
    end your file in .oxi (it might be optional, but it looks cool).
  The syntax of the language is laid out in the example file, but there are likely more features like strings, etc. (use trial and error or look at the source code)
  A large amount of debugging information is displayed when your program is running.
